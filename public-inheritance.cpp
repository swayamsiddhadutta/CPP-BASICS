// Best practice (in terms of modes of inheritance):
// Use public inheritance unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise

// Protected inheritance is the least common method of inheritance. 
// It is almost never used, except in very particular cases. With protected inheritance, the public and protected members become protected, 
// and private members stay inaccessible.

// Private inheritance can be useful when the derived class has no obvious relationship to the base class, but uses the base class for 
// implementation internally. In such a case, we probably donâ€™t want the public interface of the base class to be exposed through objects 
// of the derived class (as it would be if we inherited publicly).
// With private inheritance, the public and protected members become protected, 
// and private members stay inaccessible.



// By default, C++ invokes private inheritance (just like by default members of a class are private)
// class Derived : Base ---> PRIVATE inheritance
